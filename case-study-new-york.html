                  Citizens can plot proposals on an online map. Offline idea gathering also happens in public places and meetings.

                  Throughout this stage citizens can volunteer to become ‘budget delegates’. The budget delegates who are chosen for this role met regularly to develop proposals and prioritise them. Proposals are prioritised based on: feasibility, need and equity (what would have greatest impact on those currently least served). Budget delegates can get help from council staff with this, and are encouraged to carry out their own research on their communities to inform these decisions. Their highest priority ideas will go forward to the vote.

                  Voting is carried out online and at busy offline locations like subway stations. Marketplace events are also used to showcase proposals and allow residents to cast their vote.
